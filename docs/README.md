## Introduction

What is Keel?

Keel aims to be a simple, robust, **background** service that automatically updates Kubernetes workloads so users can focus on important things like writing code, testing and admiring their creation.

While [Container Builder](https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/docs/) and [Google Container Engine (Kubernetes)](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/) make a great pair and building images and running your workloads - there is a missing gap: who/what updates deployments when new images are available? maybe it is you:

1. update image tag in `deployment.yaml`
2. run `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`

These updates can be repetitive, lacking control (user needs access to the cluster) and simply not necessary. This is what Keel solves: pluggable trigger system (webhooks, pubsub, polling) and pluggable provider system (Kubernetes, Helm).

## Installation

Keel doesn't need a database. Keel doesn't need persistent disk. It gets all required information from your cluster. This makes it truly cloud-native and easy to deploy.

### Prerequisites

- **Kubernetes environment** (easiest way to get Kubernetes up and running is probably [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/) or [Docker for Mac with Kubernetes](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/kubernetes/) or [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube).
- **[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/)**: Kubernetes client

> We assume that your kubectl can access Kubernetes environment. If you have multiple environments, you should use **kubectl config use-context [your cluster]** command.

### Deploying with kubectl 

You can find sample deployments in https://github.com/keel-hq/keel repository under [deployments directory](https://github.com/keel-hq/keel/tree/master/deployment). You can either clone whole repository or just download that file. Edit settings (depending on your environment whether you want to use [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/) PUBSUB) or notifications and create it. All configuration is done through environment variables.

You can also use [sunstone.dev](https://about.sunstone.dev) to generate a template with latest semver version or use `latest` tag:

```
# To override default latest semver tag, add &tag=x.x.x query argument to the URL below
kubectl apply -f https://sunstone.dev/keel?namespace=keel&username=admin&password=admin&tag=latest
```

This command will deploy Keel to **keel** namespace with enabled basic authentication and admin dashboard.

To check whether it successfully started - check pods:

```bash
kubectl -n keel get pods
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
$ kubectl -n keel get pods
NAME                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
keel-2732121452-k7sjc   1/1       Running   0          14s
```

#### Uninstalling Keel

To remove Keel from your system, simply delete Keel namespace

```bash
kubectl delete namespace keel
```

### Deploying with Helm

Prerequisites:

- Helm - [https://helm.sh/](https://helm.sh/)
- Kubernetes

You need to add this Chart repo to Helm:

```bash
helm repo add keel https://charts.keel.sh 
helm repo update
```

Install through Helm (with Helm provider enabled by default):

> Keel must be installed into the same namespace as Tiller, typically <code>kube-system</code>

```
helm upgrade --install keel --namespace=kube-system keel/keel
```

If you work mostly with regular Kubernetes manifests, you can install Keel without Helm provider support:

```
helm upgrade --install keel --namespace=keel keel-charts/keel --set helmProvider.enabled="false" 
```

You can view all available settings in our [chart directory](https://github.com/keel-hq/keel/tree/master/chart/keel). Feel free to download values.yaml and edit the settings.

#### Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `keel` deployment:

```bash
helm delete keel
```

### Environment variables

```bash
# Google Cloud configuration

```

### Enabling admin dashboard

::: warning
Follow [these instruction on how to enable admin UI](/docs/#enabling-admin-dashboard). Admin dashboard hasn't been fully released yet, it's only available through the `latest` tag or if you compile Keel from the `master` branch. 
:::

To enable admin dashboard, you will need to:

1. Set BASIC_AUTH_USER and BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD environment variables
2. Create a service so you can access it. Keel UI and API are accessible on port 9300 by default.

To access Keel admin dashboard without configuring public IP, you can use [webhookrelay.com](https://webhookrelay.com) tunnels. There's a default template to generate Keel configuration with tunnels enabled. First get a [token](https://my.webhookrelay.com/tunnels) & [tunnel](https://my.webhookrelay.com/tunnels), then deploy through [sunstone.dev](https://about.sunstone.dev):

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://sunstone.dev/keel?namespace=default&username=admin&password=admin&relay_key=TOKEN_KEY&relay_secret=TOKEN_SECRET&relay_tunnel=TUNNEL_NAME&tag=latest
```

Then, access it through the tunnel address such as your-subdomain.webrelay.io:

![Keel Web UI](/img/keel_ui.png)

Admin dashboard allows you to:

* Enable/disable automated updates
* Set/change policies
* Enable/disable polling
* View all tracked images
* See audit logs (updates, approvals)
* Last 30 days statistics

## Policies

Use policies to define when you want your application to be updated. Providers can have different mechanisms of getting configuration for your application, but policies are consistent across all of them. Following [semver](http://semver.org/) 
best practices allows you to safely automate application updates.

Available policies:

-  **all**: update whenever there is a version bump or a new prerelease created (ie: `1.0.0` -> `1.0.1-rc1`)
-  **major**: update major & minor & patch versions
-  **minor**: update only minor & patch versions (ignores major)
-  **patch**: update only patch versions (ignores minor and major versions)
-  **force**: force update even if tag is not semver, ie: `latest`, optional label: **keel.sh/match-tag=true** which will enforce that only the same tag will trigger force update.
-  **glob**: use wildcards to match versions, example:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata: 
  name: wd
  namespace: default
  labels: 
      name: "wd"
  annotations:
      keel.sh/policy: "glob:build-*"  # <- build-1, build-2, build-foo will match this. 
```

- **regexp**: use regular expressions to match versions, example:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata: 
  name: wd
  namespace: default
  labels: 
      name: "wd"
  annotations:
      keel.sh/policy: "regexp:^([a-zA-Z]+)$"
```

### Pre-release tags

According to semver (http://semver.org/) spec, version tags can have additional metadata such as `1.0.0-dev`, `1.0.0-prod`, etc. Keel deals with semver tags by only allowing updates with the same version metadata.

Example:

- tag: `0.5.0-dev` policy: `minor` will only be updated by `0.6.0-dev` and not `0.5.0-prod`
- tag `0.5.0` policy: `minor` will not be updated by `0.6.0-rc1`

This way you can easily separate different environments and update them independently.

## Additional settings

Keel tries to mostly rely on your resource configuration files, such as deployment, daemonset, statefulset labels & annotations. Here is an example with all available options:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: wd-ds
  namespace: default
  labels: 
      name: "wd"
  annotations:
      keel.sh/policy: minor     # update policy (available: patch, minor, major, all, force)
      keel.sh/trigger: poll     # enable active repository checking (webhooks and GCR would still work)
      keel.sh/approvals: "1"    # required approvals to update
      keel.sh/match-tag: "true" # only makes a difference when used with 'force' policy, will only update if tag matches :dev->:dev, :prod->:prod 
      keel.sh/pollSchedule: "@every 1m"
      keel.sh/notify: chan1,chan2    # chat channels to send notification to
      keel.sh/initContainers: "true" # track init containers (disabled by default)
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: wd-ds
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: wd-ds
    spec:      
      containers:
      - name: wd-ds
        image: karolisr/webhook-demo:master
        imagePullPolicy: Always            
        name: wd
        command: ["/bin/webhook-demo"]
        ports:
          - containerPort: 8090       
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /healthz
            port: 8090
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          timeoutSeconds: 10
```


## Providers

Providers are direct integrations into schedulers or other tools (ie: Helm). Providers are handling events created by triggers. Each provider can handle events in different ways, for example Kubernetes provider identifies impacted deployments and starts rolling update while Helm provider communicates with Tiller, identifies releases by Chart and then starts update. 

Available providers:

- Kubernetes (supports Deployments, DaemonSets, StatefulSets)
- Helm

While the goal is often the same, different providers can choose different update strategies.

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes provider was the first, simplest provider added to Keel. Policies and trigger configuration for each application deployment is done through labels. 

Policies are specified through a special annotation:

```
keel.sh/policy=all
```

A policy to update only minor releases:

```
keel.sh/policy=minor
```

### Kubernetes example

Here is an example application `deployment.yaml` where we instruct Keel to update container image whenever there is a new version:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata: 
  name: wd
  namespace: default
  labels: 
      name: "wd"
  annotations:
      keel.sh/policy: all
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      name: wd
      labels:
        app: wd        

    spec:
      containers:                    
        - image: karolisr/webhook-demo:0.0.2
          imagePullPolicy: Always            
          name: wd
          command: ["/bin/webhook-demo"]
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8090       
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /healthz
              port: 8090
            initialDelaySeconds: 30
            timeoutSeconds: 10
          securityContext:
            privileged: true      
```

If Keel gets an event that `karolisr/webhook-demo:0.0.3` is available - it will update deployment and therefore start a rolling update.

### StatefulSet example

StatefulSets can also be updated by Kubernetes once image has changed:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: wd
  namespace: default
  labels: 
      name: "wd"
  annotations:
      keel.sh/policy: major    
spec:
  replicas: 1
  serviceName: "wd"
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wd
  template:
    metadata:
      name: wd
      labels:
        app: wd        
    spec:      
      containers:                    
        - image: karolisr/webhook-demo:0.0.8
          imagePullPolicy: Always            
          name: wd
          command: ["/bin/webhook-demo"]
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8090       
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /healthz
              port: 8090
            initialDelaySeconds: 30
            timeoutSeconds: 10              
```

### Deployment polling example

While the deployment above works perfect for both webhook and Google Cloud Pubsub triggers sometimes you can't control these events and the only available solution is to check registry yourself. This is where polling trigger comes to the rescue.

::: warning
**Note**: when image with non-semver style tag is supplied (ie: `latest`) Keel will monitor SHA digest. If tag is semver - it will track and notify providers when new versions are available.
:::

Add annotations:

```
keel.sh/policy=force # add this to enable updates of non-semver tags
keel.sh/trigger=poll
```

To specify custom polling schedule, use *keel.sh/pollSchedule: "@every 10m"* annotation. A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". 

::: tip
**Note** that even if polling trigger is set - webhooks or pubsub events can still trigger updates
:::

Example deployment file for polling:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata: 
  name: wd
  namespace: default
  labels: 
      name: "wd"
  annotations:
      keel.sh/policy: force
      keel.sh/trigger: poll      
      keel.sh/pollSchedule: "@every 10m"
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      name: wd
      labels:
        app: wd        

    spec:
      containers:
        - image: karolisr/webhook-demo:latest # this would start repository digest checks
          imagePullPolicy: Always            
          name: wd
          command: ["/bin/webhook-demo"]
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8090       
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /healthz
              port: 8090
            initialDelaySeconds: 30
            timeoutSeconds: 10
          securityContext:
            privileged: true      
```

### DaemonSet polling example

Since DaemonSets have labels and annotations, their configuration is not different from Deployment or StatefulSet configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: wd-ds
  namespace: default
  labels: 
      name: "wd"
  annotations:
      keel.sh/policy: minor
      keel.sh/trigger: poll            
      keel.sh/pollSchedule: "@every 1m"          
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: wd-ds
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: wd-ds
    spec:      
      containers:
      - name: wd-ds
        image: karolisr/webhook-demo:0.0.8
        imagePullPolicy: Always            
        name: wd
        command: ["/bin/webhook-demo"]
        ports:
          - containerPort: 8090       
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /healthz
            port: 8090
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          timeoutSeconds: 10
        securityContext:
          privileged: true         
```

### Helm 


Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications — Helm Charts helps you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application. More information can be found on project's website [https://helm.sh/](https://helm.sh/). 

Keel works directly with Tiller (a daemon that is used by Helm CLI) to manage release upgrades when new images are available. 

### Helm example

Keel is configured through your chart's `values.yaml` file.

Here is an example application `values.yaml` file where we instruct Keel to track and update specific values whenever there is a new version:

```yaml
replicaCount: 1
image:
  repository: karolisr/webhook-demo
  tag: "0.0.8"
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
service:
  name: webhookdemo
  type: ClusterIP
  externalPort: 8090
  internalPort: 8090

keel:
  # keel policy (all/major/minor/patch/force)
  policy: all
  # images to track and update
  images:
    - repository: image.repository # [1]
      tag: image.tag  # [2]
```

If Keel gets an event that `karolisr/webhook-demo:0.0.9` is available - it will upgrade release values so Helm can start updating your application.

* [1]  resolves during runtime image.repository -> karolisr/webhook-demo
* [2]  resolves during runtime image.tag -> 0.0.8

### Helm same tag force updates

If you are not using versioning and pushing to the same tag, you should modify your template to change it on each update.

Current consensus on a best way to "force" update Helm releases is by modifying your pod spec template by adding:


```yaml
date/deploy-date: {{ now | quote }}
```

annotation. This way Helm's Tiller will always detect a change in your template and Kubernetes will start a rolling update on the resource.


#### Helm configuration polling example

This example demonstrates Keel configuration for polling.

::: tip
**Note** that even if polling trigger is set - webhooks or pubsub events can still trigger updates
:::

```yaml
replicaCount: 1
image:
  repository: karolisr/webhook-demo
  tag: "0.0.8"
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
service:
  name: webhookdemo
  type: ClusterIP
  externalPort: 8090
  internalPort: 8090

keel:
  # keel policy (all/major/minor/patch/force)
  policy: all
  # trigger type, defaults to events such as pubsub, webhooks
  trigger: poll
  # polling schedule
  pollSchedule: "@every 2m"
  # images to track and update
  images:
    - repository: image.repository # [1]
      tag: image.tag  # [2]
```

#### Helm polling private registry

If you are polling a private repository, you can set secret name for an image to use for authentication:

```yaml
replicaCount: 1
image:
  repository: karolisr/webhook-demo
  tag: "0.0.8"
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
service:
  name: webhookdemo
  type: ClusterIP
  externalPort: 8090
  internalPort: 8090

keel:
  # keel policy (all/major/minor/patch/force)
  policy: all
  # trigger type, defaults to events such as pubsub, webhooks
  trigger: poll
  # polling schedule
  pollSchedule: "@every 2m"
  # images to track and update
  images:
    - repository: image.repository
      tag: image.tag  
      imagePullSecret: my-secret-name
```

## Triggers

Triggers are entry points into the Keel. Their task is to collect information regarding updated images and send events to providers.

Available triggers:

- Webhooks
  * Native Webhooks
  * DockerHub Webhooks
  * Quay Webhooks
  * Harbor webhooks
  * Gitlab webhooks
  * Github Webhooks
  * Receiving webhooks without public endpoint
- Google Cloud GCR registry
- Polling

### Webhooks

Webhooks are "user-defined HTTP callbacks". They are usually triggered by some event, such as pushing image to a registry. Native webhooks (simplified version) are accepted at `/v1/webhooks/native` endpoint with a payload that has __name__ and __tag__ fields: 

```json
{
  "name": "gcr.io/v2-namespace/hello-world", 
  "tag": "1.1.1"
}
```

> Keel by default runs HTTP server on port 9300. Create a service and either expose it to the internet or use [https://webhookrelay.com](https://webhookrelay.com) to receive webhooks.

### DockerHub Webhooks

DockerHub uses webhooks to inform 3rd party systems about repository related events such as pushed image.

https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/webhooks - go to your repository on 
`https://hub.docker.com/r/your-namespace/your-repository/~/settings/webhooks/` and point webhooks
to `/v1/webhooks/dockerhub` endpoint. Any number of repositories 
can send events to this endpoint.


### Quay Webhooks 

Documentation on how to setup Quay webhooks for __Repository Push__ events is available here: [https://docs.quay.io/guides/notifications.html](https://docs.quay.io/guides/notifications.html). These webhooks should be delivered to `/v1/webhooks/quay` endpoint. Any number of repositories 
can send events to this endpoint.


### Azure Webhooks

Documentation on how to setup Azure webhooks is available here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-webhook. Azure webhooks should be delivered to `/v1/webhooks/azure` endpoint.

### Harbor webhooks

Keel supports https://github.com/goharbor/harbor webhooks. Harbor webhooks should be delivered to `/v1/webhooks/registry` endpoint. Harbor webhooks are based on [Docker registry notifications](https://docs.docker.com/registry/notifications/).

### Gitlab webhooks

Keel supports Gitlab registry notifications also known as webhooks (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/container_registry.html#configure-container-registry-notifications). Gitlab webhooks should be delivered to `/v1/webhooks/registry` endpoint. Gitlab webhooks are based on [Docker registry notifications](https://docs.docker.com/registry/notifications/).

### Github Webhooks

Keel supports Github packages (https://github.com/features/packages). Github webhooks should be delivered to `/v1/webhooks/github` endpoint. In the Repository -> Setting -> Webhooks menu, set `Content Type: application/json`, and select Event `Packages`.

### Receiving webhooks without public endpoint

If you don't want to expose your Keel service - recommended solution is [https://webhookrelay.com/](https://webhookrelay.com/) which can deliver webhooks to your internal Keel service through a sidecar container.

Example sidecar container configuration for your `deployments.yaml`:

```yaml
        - image: webhookrelay/webhookrelayd:latest
          name: webhookrelayd          
          env:                         
            - name: KEY
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: webhookrelay-credentials
                  key: key                
            - name: SECRET
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: webhookrelay-credentials
                  key: secret
            - name: BUCKET
              value: dockerhub      
```

### Google Cloud GCR registry  

If you are using Google Container Engine with Container Registry - search no more, pubsub trigger is for you.

<p class="tip">You will need to create a Google Service Account to use PubSub functionality.</p>

Since Keel requires access for the pubsub in GCE Kubernetes to work - your cluster node pools need to have permissions. If you are creating a new cluster - just enable pubsub from the start. If you have an existing cluster - currently the only way is to create a new node-pool through the gcloud CLI (more info in the [docs](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/node-pools/create?hl=en_US&_ga=1.2114551.650086469.1487625651)):


#### Create a node pool with enabled pubsub scope

```bash
gcloud container node-pools create new-pool --cluster CLUSTER_NAME --scopes https://www.googleapis.com/auth/pubsub

#### Create a service account

Detailed tutorial on creating and configuring service account to access Google services is available here: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/authenticating-to-cloud-platform.

High level steps:

1. Create a service account through Google cloud console with a role: `roles/pubsub.editor` (Keel needs to create topics as well for GCR registries).
2. Furnish a new private key and choose key type as JSON.
3. Import credentials as a secret:
```bash
kubectl create -n <KEEL NAMESPACE> secret generic pubsub-key --from-file=key.json=<PATH-TO-KEY-FILE>.json
```
4. Configure the application with the Secret

#### Update Keel's environment variables

Make sure that in the deployment.yaml you have set environment variables __PUBSUB=1__,  __PROJECT_ID=your-project-id__ and __GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS__ to your secrets yaml. 


### Polling

Since only the owners of docker registries can control webhooks - it's often convenient to use
polling. Be aware that registries can be rate limited so it's a good practice to set up reasonable polling intervals.
While configuration for each provider can be slightly different - each provider has to accept several polling parameters:

* Explicitly enable polling trigger
* Supply polling schedule (defaults to 1 minute intervals)

#### Cron expression format

Custom polling schedule can be specified as cron format or through predefined schedules (recommended solution). 

Available schedules:


Entry                  | Description                                | Equivalent To
-----                  | -----------                                | -------------
@yearly (or @annually) | Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st        | `0 0 0 1 1 *`
@monthly               | Run once a month, midnight, first of month | `0 0 0 1 * *`
@weekly                | Run once a week, midnight on Sunday        | `0 0 0 * * 0`
@daily (or @midnight)  | Run once a day, midnight                   | `0 0 0 * * *`
@hourly                | Run once an hour, beginning of hour        | `0 0 * * * *`

Example deployment file with enabled polling:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: wd-ds
  namespace: default
  labels: 
      name: "wd"
  annotations:
      keel.sh/policy: minor     # update policy (available: patch, minor, major, all, force)
      keel.sh/trigger: poll     # enable active repository checking (webhooks and GCR would still work)
      keel.sh/pollSchedule: "@every 1m"
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: wd-ds
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: wd-ds
    spec:      
      containers:
      - name: wd-ds
        image: karolisr/webhook-demo:master
        imagePullPolicy: Always            
        name: wd
        command: ["/bin/webhook-demo"]
        ports:
          - containerPort: 8090
```


### Polling with AWS ECR

If you are using polling trigger with Amazon ECR registry, Keel deployment requires several environment variables:

```shell
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA.........
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=3v..............
AWS_REGION=us-east-2 # <- where your registry is
```

Documentation on setting up credentials can be found here: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/awsrbflowguide/set-up-creds.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/awsrbflowguide/set-up-creds.html).

#### IAM Role

You can also take advantage of the `iam-role` without using explicit keys in the environmental variables. You can attach the following policy to your role

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecr:*",
                "ec2:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

In your `Keel` deployment file, you simply need to add the specific annotation to use your role. For example, if you ise `kube2iam` you should add the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: keel
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        iam.amazonaws.com/role: arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/my-role
```

If you use the Helm Chart to deploy Keel, you just need to add the annotation under the `podAnnotations` object in the `values.yml`.

#### Intervals

You may also schedule a job to execute at fixed intervals. This is supported by formatting the cron spec like this:

`@every <duration>`

where _duration_ is a string accepted by [time.ParseDuration](http://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).

For example, _@every 1h30m10s_ would indicate a schedule that activates every 1 hour, 30 minutes, 10 seconds.

> **Tip**: If you want to disable polling support for your Keel installation - set environment variable
__POLL=0__.


## Approvals

Users can specify on deployments and Helm charts how many approvals do they have to collect before a resource gets updated. Main features:

* __non-blocking__ - multiple deployments/helm releases can be queued for approvals, the ones without specified approvals will be auto updated.
* __extensible__ - current implementation focuses on Slack but additional approval collection mechanisms are trivial to implement.
* __out of the box Slack integration__ - the only needed Keel configuration is Slack auth token, Keel will start requesting approvals and users will be able to approve.
* __stateful__ - uses SQLite for persistence so even after updating itself (restarting) it will retain existing info.
* __self cleaning__ - expired approvals will be removed after deadline is exceeded. 

### Enabling approvals

Approvals are enabled by default but currently there is only one way to approve/reject updates:
Slack - commands like:

* `keel get approvals` - get all pending/approved/rejected approvals
* `keel approve <identifier>` - approve specified request.
* `keel reject <identifier>` - reject specified request.

Make sure you have set `export SLACK_TOKEN=<your slack token here>` environment variable for Keel deployment.

If you wish to specify a special channel for approval requests, supply `SLACK_APPROVALS_CHANNEL=<approvals channel name>` environment variable and then invite Keel bot to that channel.

### Configuring via Kubernetes deployments

The only required configuration for Kubernetes deployment to enable approvals is to add `keel.sh/approvals: "1"` with a number (string! as the underlying type is map[string]string) of required approvals.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata: 
  name: wd
  namespace: default
  labels: 
      name: "wd"
  annotations:
      keel.sh/policy: all
      keel.sh/trigger: poll      
      keel.sh/approvals: "1"
```

### Configuring via Helm charts

To enable approvals for a Helm chart update Keel config section in `values.yaml` with a required number of approvals:

```yaml
replicaCount: 1
image:
  repository: karolisr/webhook-demo
  tag: "0.0.13"
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent 
service:
  name: webhookdemo
  type: ClusterIP
  externalPort: 8090
  internalPort: 8090

keel:
  # keel policy (all/major/minor/patch/force)
  policy: all
  # trigger type, defaults to events such as pubsub, webhooks
  trigger: poll
  # polling schedule
  pollSchedule: "@every 1m"
  # approvals required to proceed with an update
  approvals: 1
  # approvals deadline in hours
  approvalDeadline: 24 
  # images to track and update
  images:
    - repository: image.repository
      tag: image.tag
```

### Configuring approvals with Slack

Slack configuration can be sometimes quite confusing. If something has changed, please create an issue.

#### Step 1: adding bot app and getting token

Go to your Slack apps page: https://[your-slack-community].slack.com/apps/A0F7YS25R-bots?page=1

![Slack bots](/img/docs/slack-bots.png)

Set name to Keel

![Slack bot name](/img/docs/slack-bot-name.png)


#### Step 2: supplying token to Keel

Use provided token as an environment variable in Keel's deployment:

`SLACK_TOKEN=token`

### Approving through Slack example

Keel will send notifications to your Slack group about pending approvals. Approval process is as simple as replying to Keel:

- Approve: `keel approve default/whr:0.4.12`
- Reject it: `keel reject default/whr:0.4.12`

Example conversation:

![Approvals](/img/docs/approvals.png)

### Approving through Hipchat example

Coming soon...

### Managing approvals through HTTP endpoint

For third party integrations it can be useful to approve/reject/delete via HTTP endpoint. You can send an approval request via HTTP endpoint:

**Method**: POST
**Endpoint**: `/v1/approvals`

```json
{
  "identifier": "default/myimage:1.5.5", // <- identifier for the approval request
  "action": "approve", // <- approve/reject/delete, defaults to "approve"
  "voter": "john",  
}
```

### Listing pending approvals through HTTP endpoint

You can also view pending/rejected/approved update request on `/v1/approvals` Keel endpoint (make sure you have service exported). Example response:

**Method**: GET
**Endpoint**: `/v1/approvals`


```json
[
	{
		"provider": "helm",
		"identifier": "default/wd:0.0.15",
		"event": {
			"repository": {
				"host": "",
				"name": "index.docker.io/karolisr/webhook-demo",
				"tag": "0.0.15",
				"digest": ""
			},
			"createdAt": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
			"triggerName": "poll"
		},
		"message": "New image is available for release default/wd (0.0.13 -> 0.0.15).",
		"currentVersion": "0.0.13",
		"newVersion": "0.0.15",
		"votesRequired": 1,
		"deadline": "2017-09-26T09:14:54.979211563+01:00",
		"createdAt": "2017-09-26T09:14:54.980936804+01:00",
		"updatedAt": "2017-09-26T09:14:54.980936824+01:00"
	}
]
```

## Notifications

Keel can send notifications on successful or failed deployment updates.  There are several types of notifications - trusted webhooks or Slack, Hipchat, Mattermost, Teams messages.

Notification types:

__Pre-deployment update__ - fired before doing update. Can be used to drain running tasks.

```json
{
	"name":"preparing to update deployment",
	"message":"Preparing to update deployment <your deployment namespace/name> (gcr.io/webhookrelay/webhook-demo:0.0.10)",
	"createdAt":"2017-07-23T23:51:46.478440258+01:00",
	"type":"preparing deployment update",
	"level":"LevelDebug"
}
```

__Successful deployment update__ - fired after successful update.

```json
{
	"name":"deployment update",
	"message":"Successfully updated deployment <your deployment namespace/name> (gcr.io/webhookrelay/webhook-demo:0.0.10)",
	"createdAt":"2017-07-23T23:51:46.478440258+01:00",
	"type":"deployment update",
	"level":"LevelSuccess"
}
```

__Failed deployment update__ - fired after failed event.

```json
{
	"name":"deployment update",
	"message":"Deployment <your deployment namespace/name> (gcr.io/webhookrelay/webhook-demo:0.0.10) update failed, error: <error here> ", 
	"createdAt":"2017-07-23T23:51:46.478440258+01:00",
	"type":"deployment update",
	"level":"LevelError"
}
```

### Release notes in notifications

You can optionally set a release notes link (or anything that's allowed by `annotation` value or Helm chart value) in your configuration.

If you are using Kubernetes, use annotation `keel.sh/releaseNotes`:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata: 
  name: wd
  namespace: default
  labels: 
      name: "wd"
  annotations:
      keel.sh/policy: minor
      keel.sh/releaseNotes: "https://github.com/keel-hq/keel/releases"
```

If you are using Helm, your Keel config now accepts `releaseNotes`:

```yaml
name: app1
image:
  repository: gcr.io/v2-namespace/hello-world
  tag: 1.1.0

keel:  
  policy: force  
  trigger: poll  
  images:
    - repository: image.repository
      tag: image.tag
      releaseNotes: https://github.com/keel-hq/keel/releases			

```

Release notes will be sent with a successful update.

### Webhook notifications

To enabled webhook notifications provide an endpoint via __WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT__ environment variable inside Keel deployment. 

Webhook payload sample:

```json
{
	"name": "update deployment",
	"message": "Successfully updated deployment default/wd (karolisr/webhook-demo:0.0.10)",
	"createdAt": "2017-07-08T10:08:45.226565869+01:00"	
}
```

### Slack notifications

![Slack notifications](/img/docs/slack-notifications.png)

First, get a Slack token, info about that can be found in the [docs](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/215770388-Create-and-regenerate-API-tokens). Then, provide token via __SLACK_TOKEN__ environment variable. You should also provide __SLACK_CHANNELS__ environment variable with a comma separated list of channels where these notifications should be delivered to.

Keel will be sending messages when deployment updates succeed or fail.


### HipChat notifications

::: warning
HipChat documentation is missing, if you are using it, please add some examples. 
:::

### Mattermost notifications

[Mattermost](https://about.mattermost.com/) is an open source Slack alternative, it's written in Go and React.

If you don't have a Mattermost server, you can set one up by using Docker:

```bash
docker run --name mattermost-preview -d --publish 8065:8065 mattermost/mattermost-preview
```

Server should be reachable on: http://localhost:8065/

Now, enable "incoming webhooks" in your Mattermost server. Documentation can be found [in the incoming webhooks section](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/webhooks-incoming.html):

![Mattermost webhooks](/img/docs/mattermost-webhooks.png)

Also, you should enable icon and username override so users know that webhooks are coming from Keel:

![Mattermost username and icon override](/img/docs/mattermost-icon-username.png)

Now, set `MATTERMOST_ENDPOINT` environment variable for Keel with your Mattermost webhook endpoint:

![Mattermost configuration](/img/docs/mattermost-configuration.png)

That's it, Keel notifications for Mattermost enabled:

![Mattermost notification](/img/docs/mattermost-notification.png)

> If you want to override bot's username, you can supply `MATTERMOST_USERNAME=somethingelse` environment variable.

### Teams notifications
MS Teams allows you to [set up a custom incoming webhook](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/connectors-using#setting-up-a-custom-incoming-webhook).

The process linked above results in a webhook url. Pass that to Keel via the `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL=https://the.webhook/provided/by/teams` environment variable.

### Discord notifications
Discord allows you to [set up incoming webhooks in a channel](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).

Configure notifications by setting the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://the.webhook/provided/by/discord` environment variable.

### ntfy notifications
ntfy [lets you send push notifications](https://docs.ntfy.sh/) to your phone or desktop via scripts from any computer, using simple HTTP PUT or POST requests.

Configure notifications by setting the `NTFY_WEBHOOK_URL=https://the.ntfy.instance/your-topic` environment variable.

### Notification levels

Set notification levels via `NOTIFICATION_LEVEL` environment variable. Available levels: debug, info, success, warn, error, fatal. This setting defaults to `info`.

### Overriding default channels per deployment

Some notification providers such as Slack and Hipchat allow apps to send notifications to multiple channels.

For standard Kubernetes deployments use annotation with channels separated by commas: `keel.sh/notify=channelName1,channelName2`.

![notifications per deployment](/img/docs/notify-per-deployment.png)

For Helm chart please specify `notificationChannels` string list to Keel config section in *values.yaml*:

```yaml
notificationChannels:
  - chan1
  - chan2
```

Your *values.yaml* should look like this:

![notifications per chart](/img/docs/notify-per-chart.png)
